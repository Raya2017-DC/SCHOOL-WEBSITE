                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Since opening in 2007, with loads of enthusiasm and just a few worn footballs, Evo Sports has grown into the largest multi-sport coaching organisation in Qatar. Our team shares a passion for everything positive in sport. We believe in being inclusive and helping people to achieve whatever they want from getting involved, whether it’s professional coaching, team sports, getting fit, making friends, holiday sports camps or just a bit of fun. Evo Sports is here for everyone!

                        Our members are at the heart of everything we do and we’re proud of the wonderful relationships that have grown over the years. Our values of professionalism, respect, friendship, inclusion, pride, integrity and excellence are the foundations of our organisation. We are also proud to be recognised for our excellence in providing sport activities and training. Amongst other achievements, we were delighted to be chosen as a case study to demonstrate the benefits of community sport, during Qatar’s FIFA World Cup 2022 bid.

                        We were delighted to receive ‘Best Multi Sports Youth Coaching Company – Qatar 2019’ by GHP Fitness and nutrition awards.

                        Since 2011 we’ve been based at Doha College, where we enjoy some of the country’s best sports facilities. Stay tuned for news about the world-class new sports centre opening later this year at the College! We look forward to welcoming you to Evo Sport, whatever your passion! </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Every student at Doha College is a member of a House. The house system forms an important part of the DC community as it encourages healthy competition in academic, sporting, and cultural spheres; and enables students to mix and make friends across all year groups.

                        The house system is aimed at developing student participation and celebrating success in several house activities both curricular and co-curricular; and competitions that are keenly contested and hugely enjoyed throughout the year. It presents the opportunity to reward work within and beyond the classroom setting, whilst developing values of cooperation and teamwork amongst the students and staff. <br>
                        Student achievements are celebrated through a reward system. House points are awarded throughout the year, recognising not only academic success but also sporting achievement, effort, attendance and good progress; and certificates are presented on reaching certain milestones.

                        In Secondary, house certificates are awarded to students who have attained a certain number of house points; and are distributed during year group assemblies. Certificates for excellence and the Governor’s award are awarded at whole school assemblies at the end of each term.

                        In Primary, house certificates are awarded to students at weekly assemblies, where their achievements are celebrated. </p>
